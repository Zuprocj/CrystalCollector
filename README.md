# unit-4-game

Created the crystal collector game according to the homework requirements.  Just like the last assignment I had trouble with the javascript.  However, this time around I was able to organize my thought process through better pseudo-coding.  The way I approached the assigment was stating what global variables I would have, then functions that I would need to have to run the game, and finally the click functions.
